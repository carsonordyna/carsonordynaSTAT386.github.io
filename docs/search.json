    "text": "The Cox Proportional Hazards Model: A Brief Introduction and Demo\n\nOutline\n\nIntroduction\nThe Mathematical Model\nA Brief Demo\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nA doctor’s stethoscope\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn clinical research, it is valuable to be able to model and predict whether a patient will experience a specified event (e.g. death, the return of a disease like cancer, etc.). Just as important is being able to model and predict when such an event occurs (e.g. 3 years after the diagnosis of a cancer at a particular stage). This is a foundational focus of survival analysis: the use of statistical models trained on time-to-event data. One of the most common and powerful tools in survival analysis is the Cox Proportional Hazards Model (Cox model for short), which helps us understand how different factors (age, treatment, comorbidities, etc.) influence a given individual’s changing, moment-to-moment risk of experiencing a given event over a period of time.\nFor the last several months, I have had the privilege of working on a clinical research team at Massachusetts General Hospital. As I have reviewed scientific literature regarding lung cancer and surgical pproaches to treating it, I have seen firsthand how prevelent this model is in medical/clinical research. This post offers a brief introduction to the Cox model and a simple, hands-on demo using Python.\n\n\nThe Mathematical Model\nAt the core of the Cox model is the hazard function. A hazard function, \\(\\lambda (t)\\), is one that indicates the instantaneous rate of an event occurring—in other words, the instantaneous risk of experiencing the event (e.g. death)—at a specific time, \\(t\\). The baseline hazard function \\(\\lambda_0 (t)\\) refers to the hazard function when explanatory variables (i.e. covariates), \\(X\\), are at their baseline levels (e.g. when no treatment/medication is given, when a particular comorbidity is not present, etc.). That is, \\(X_i = 0\\) for all \\(i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n \\}\\) for \\(n\\) covariates. The effect of each covariate is denoted as \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\beta_i\\) denoting the effect of the \\(i\\)-th covariate. The overall hazard function, \\(\\lambda(t \\mid X)\\), is as follows:\n\\[\n\\lambda(t \\mid X) = \\lambda_0 (t) e^{\\displaystyle \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n X_n}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X =\\) \\((X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)\\) is the covariate vector. Note that if \\(\\beta_i &gt; 0\\), then increasing \\(X_i\\) (or \\(X_i = 1\\) if binary) means an increased risk, and if \\(\\beta_i &lt; 0\\), then increasing \\(X_i\\) (or \\(X_i = 1\\) if binary) means a decreased risk. In the case of a single covariate, \\(\\beta_1\\), it can be shown that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda(t \\mid x + 1)}{\\lambda(t \\mid x)} = e^{\\displaystyle \\beta_1}\n\\]\nWhen comparing two patients, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), in the single covariate case, it can also be shown that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda(t \\mid X_a)}{\\lambda(t \\mid X_b)} = e^{\\displaystyle \\beta_1(X_a - X_b)}\n\\]\nThe right-hand side of these equations are constants independent of time, \\(t\\). These presence of these constant proportions are the reason why the model is called the Cox Proportional Hazards model. The derivation of these results and deeper mathematical theory and background behind the model is beyond the scope of this blog. More information may be found here\n\n\n\nHazard Function Graph\n\n\n\n\nA Brief Demo\nNow, I’ll present a simple example (using the lifelines Python library, link to documentation) of how to fit and interpret a Cox model on a small, synthetic dataset.\n\n\nCode\n# Install \"lifelines\" library if not already installed\n!pip install lifelines\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Import libraries\n#| warning: false\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom lifelines import CoxPHFitter\n\n# Sample dataset\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'age': [79, 50, 45, 70, 65, 70, 53, 66, 50, 77, 58, 70, 53, 56, 71, 76, 60, 75, 68, 76],\n    'treatment': [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    'gender': [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    'duration': [1, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4, 2, 5, 5, 4, 1, 5, 5],\n    'event': [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n})\n\n# Fit the Cox model\ncph = CoxPHFitter()\ncph.fit(data, duration_col='duration', event_col='event')\n\n# Examine the results\nsummary = cph.summary[[\"coef\", \"p\", \"coef lower 95%\", \"coef upper 95%\"]]\nsummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoef\np\ncoef lower 95%\ncoef upper 95%\n\n\ncovariate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\n0.124049\n0.026572\n0.014419\n0.233679\n\n\ntreatment\n-2.023659\n0.018711\n-3.710554\n-0.336763\n\n\ngender\n0.272174\n0.736929\n-1.315843\n1.860192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summary table, at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level, we observe evidence that the \\(\\beta\\) for age and treatment is statistically different from 0. For age, the estimate of \\(\\beta\\) is positive, indicating that older individuals exhibit a higher instantaneous risk of experiencing the specified event (e.g. death). For treatment, we see that the estimate for \\(\\beta\\) is negative, indicating that individuals who receive the specified treatment (i.e. treatment = 1) exhibit a lower instantaneous risk of experiencing the specified event. Also note that the \\(\\beta\\) for gender is not statistically different from 0, indicating that gender probably does not influence an individual’s risk.\n\n\nConclusion\nTo summarize, the Cox Proportional Hazards Model is a useful tool for analyzing time-to-event data, especially in healthcare and clinical research. It allows us to quantify how different factors influence the timing of critical events.\nI invite you to further study the math behind the model and/or find a dataset of interest (e.g. from Kaggle’s medical datasets) and try fitting a Cox model using lifelines. After interpreting the results, you may consder sharing your findings in a GitHub repo or in a blog post like this one."
