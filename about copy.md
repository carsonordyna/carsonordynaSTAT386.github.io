## Get to Know Me
Lately, my personal hobbies have been reading and watching college football and basketball. I am drawn to books about history, religion, psychology, medicine, and thought-provoking memoirs/biographies. Ultimately, though, I love spending time with my wife, Abi. We enjoy cooking and eating good food together and are always open to restaurant recommendations. We also love watching movies (especially true crime documentaries).
