# Introduction 

Welcome to my data science portfolio! My name is Carson Ordyna, and I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University studying statistics. This site is an on-going project that will serve as a platform where I hope to showcase my learning, growth, and other projects that I have (or are currently) working on. Most of the content on this site will involve data science and analytics. At least for the current moment, I expect that the majority of the site's material will result from and/or be motivated by assignments in my STAT 386 (Data Science Process) course. I hope you will find my work interesting and insightful!

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work and efforts to learn and gain skills in the field of data science. For project that I display, I hope to include:

- Both my code, detailed comments, and documentation
- Any visualizations, plots, or figures that I have created
- Reflections, inights, and conclusions regarding the project itself and what I learned and discovered in the process

In addition to my projects, one may also find my biographical information, blog plots I have written, and hopefully other fascinating cotent.

## Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, and writing efficient, interpretable code 
- **Visualization**: Creating plots with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and potentially other data visualization packages
- **Data Collection**: Aquiring data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Data Cleaning**: Thinking thoughtfully about missing data and how to best handle it in terms of the data itself, the analysis, and the question(s) motivating it
- **Analysis**: Selecting appropriate statistical and machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and soundly interpreting their results
- **Discovery**: Using data to find patterns, answer questions, and fuel innovative solutions

## My Projects

### [Data Exploration Project](projects/eda.qmd)
**(Coming soon!)** This is a future STAT 386 class project where I will explore datasets to find interesting patterns and answer questions.

### [Data Collection Project](projects/data-acquisition.qmd)
**(Coming soon!)** This is a future STAT 386 class project where I will gather data from different sources and prepare it for analysis.

### [Final Project](projects/final-project.qmd)
**(Coming soon!)** This is will be the final project for my STAT 386 class where I will engage in the data science process from beginning to end.
