# Hello! My name is Carson Ordyna 👋

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics in my STAT 386 (Data Science Process) course at Brigham Young University. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered.

## 🎓 About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
